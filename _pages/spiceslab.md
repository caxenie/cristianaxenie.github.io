**Sensorimotor Processing, Intelligence, and Control in Efficient compute Systems (SPICES) Laboratory**

Welcome to the SPICES Lab, led by [Prof. Dr. Cristian Axenie](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/person/axenie-cristian/). We are a research laboratory within the [Computer Science Department](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/en/faculties/in/) at the [Technische Hochschule NÃ¼rnberg / Nuremberg Institute of Technology](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/en/) in Germany. We are sponsored by the Professorship for Artificial Intelligence for Heterogeneous Sensory Data under the prestigious [High Tech Agenda Bayern](https://www.hightechagenda.de/).

Research agenda
======
The SPICES Lab focuses on the end-to-end design, development, and deployment of closed-loop systems. Algorithmically, we specialize in neural network learning algorithms, and more specifically in spiking neural networks for intelligent multisensory fusion and control. At the data source level, we model, process, and fuse traditional as well as neuromorphic (event-based) sensory data. Finally, we deploy our algorithms on energy efficient compute systems, from embedded devices to edge devices, with a clear focus on green and sustainable learninf and inference.
