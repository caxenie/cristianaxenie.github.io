Short vita
=====

After earning a PhD in Neuroscience and Robotics from TUM in 2016, I've spent one more year with the TUM Center of Competence Neuroengineering before joining Huawei Research Center in Munich. Since 2017 I am Staff Research Engineer in Enterprise Intelligence with Huawei's largest research center outside China. At the same time, I lead the Audi Konfuzius-Institut Ingolstadt Lab, a Sino-German research initiative focused on Human-centered Intelligence Data Processing. Each term, I teach AI and ML for undergrads in TH Ingolstadt. 

I am a seasoned resercher with more than 12 years of academic research and more than 7 years of industrial research experience. My reserch was disseminated in more than 40 peer-reviewed publications and more than 10 patents.
