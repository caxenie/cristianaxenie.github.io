*Research approach*

My research agenda is centered on **data-driven science and engineering**. More precisely, I am fusing **mathematical modelling, control theory, data fusion, machine learning, simulation, and computing systems** to design and implement end-to-end solutions across domains (**robotics, embedded systems, biomedicine, virtual reality, cloud computing**). In the last **15 years**, I have consolidated an **applied research agenda** and developed **tools and a framework for optimizing dynamical systems** (i.e. biological, technical) to achieve adaptability, autonomic calibration, and reinforced performance. Fundamentally, the key approach I am using is a **domain-informed (e.g. physics-informed, biology-informed) machine learning framework** that amounts to introducing appropriate observational, inductive or learning biases that can steer the learning process towards identifying domain-consistent solutions.

*Short vita*

Since April 2023, I am **Professor of Artificial Intelligence** at the **Technische Hochschule NÃ¼rnberg Georg Simon Ohm**. After earning a **PhD in Neuroscience and Robotics** from TUM in 2016, I've spent one more year as **Research Fellow in Neuromorphic Engineering** with the TUM Center of Competence Neuroengineering before joining Huawei Research Center in Munich. Between 2017 and 2023 I was **Staff Research Engineer** in Enterprise Intelligence for Cloud Solutions with Huawei's largest research center outside China. At the same time, I was **Head of the Laboratory** and **Principal Scientist** at the [Audi Konfuzius-Institut Ingolstadt](https://audi-konfuzius-institut-ingolstadt.de/forschung/microlab-home.html), a Sino-German research initiative focused on Human-centered Intelligence Data Processing for Biomedicine and Biomechanics. Each term, between 2017 and 2021, I have taught AI and ML for undergrads as **Lecturer** at Technical University of Ingolstadt. 

I am a **seasoned researcher** with **15 years of academic research** and **7+ years of industrial research experience**. My research was disseminated in **45+ peer-reviewed publications and 10+ patents**.
