Research approach
====
My research agenda focuses on **fusing mathematical modelling, dynamical systems and control, machine learning, and computing systems** to design and implement end-to-end solutions across domains. In the last **15 years**, I have built an **applied research agenda focused on tools and a framework for optimizing dynamical systems** (i.e. biological, technical) to achieve adaptability, autonomic calibration, and reinforced performance. Fundamentally, the key approach I am using is a **domain-aware (i.e. physics-aware, biology-aware) and domain-informed (e.g. physics-informed, biology-informed) machine learning framework** that amounts to introducing appropriate observational, inductive or learning biases that can steer the learning process towards identifying domain-consistent solutions.

Short vita
=====

After earning a **PhD in Neuroscience and Robotics** from TUM in 2016, I've spent one more year as **Research Fellow in Neuromorphic Engineering** with the TUM Center of Competence Neuroengineering before joining Huawei Research Center in Munich. Since 2017 I am **Staff Research Engineer** in Enterprise Intelligence with Huawei's largest research center outside China. At the same time, I **Head of the Laboratory** at the Audi Konfuzius-Institut Ingolstadt, a Sino-German research initiative focused on Human-centered Intelligence Data Processing. Each term, I teach AI and ML for undergrads as **Lecturer** at Technical University of Ingolstadt. 

I am a **seasoned researcher** with **12+ years of academic research** and **7+ years of industrial research experience**. My research was disseminated in **40+ peer-reviewed publications and 10+ patents**.
