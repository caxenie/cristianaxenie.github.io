*Research approach*

My research agenda is centered on **data-driven science and engineering** by employing **artificial intelligence** techniques and systems. More precisely, I am fusing **mathematical modelling, control theory, data fusion, machine learning, simulation, and computing systems** to design and implement end-to-end intelligent systems solutions across domains. In the last **15 years** I have developed a **domain-informed artificial intelligence framework** that amounts to introducing appropriate observational, inductive or learning biases that can steer the learning process towards identifying domain-consistent solutions.

*Short vita*

Since April 2023, I am **Professor of Artificial Intelligence** at the **Technische Hochschule NÃ¼rnberg Georg Simon Ohm**. After earning a **PhD in Neuroscience and Robotics** from TUM in 2016, I've spent one more year as **Research Fellow in Neuromorphic Engineering** with the TUM Center of Competence Neuroengineering before joining Huawei Research Center in Munich. Between 2017 and 2023 I was **Staff Research Engineer** in Enterprise Intelligence for Cloud Solutions with Huawei's largest research center outside China. At the same time, I was **Head of the Laboratory** and **Principal Scientist** at the [Audi Konfuzius-Institut Ingolstadt](https://audi-konfuzius-institut-ingolstadt.de/forschung/microlab-home.html) at Technical University of Ingolstadt, a Sino-German research initiative focused on Human-centered Artificial Intelligence. Each term, between 2017 and 2021, I have taught AI and ML for undergrads as **Lecturer** at Technical University of Ingolstadt. 

I am a **seasoned researcher** with **15+ years of academic research** and **7+ years of industrial research experience**. My research was disseminated in **50+ peer-reviewed publications and 10+ patents**.
