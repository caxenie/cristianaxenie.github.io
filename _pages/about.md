*[Research approach](http://cristianaxenie.info/portfolio/)*

My research agenda is centered on **artificial intelligence** techniques and systems for **data-driven science and engineering** problems. More precisely, I am combining **mathematical modelling, control theory, data fusion, machine learning, simulation, and hardware** to design and implement **efficient end-to-end intelligent systems** across [domains](http://cristianaxenie.info/portfolio/).

*[Short vita](http://cristianaxenie.info/cv/)*

Since April 2023, I am **Professor of Artificial Intelligence for Hterogenous Sensor Data** at the **Technische Hochschule NÃ¼rnberg Georg Simon Ohm**. After earning a **PhD in Neuroscience and Robotics** from **Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2016**, I've spent one more year as **Research Fellow in Neuromorphic Engineering** with the **TUM Center of Competence Neuroengineering** before joining **Huawei Research Center** in Munich. Between 2017 and 2023 I was **Staff Research Engineer** in Enterprise Intelligence for Cloud Solutions with Huawei's largest research center outside China. At the same time, I was **Head of the Laboratory** and **Principal Scientist** at the [**Audi Konfuzius-Institut Ingolstadt Laboratory**](https://audi-konfuzius-institut-ingolstadt.de/forschung/microlab-home.html) at **Technical University of Ingolstadt**, a Sino-German research initiative focused on Human-centered Artificial Intelligence. Each term, between 2017 and 2021, I have taught AI and ML for undergrads as **Lecturer** at Technical University of Ingolstadt. I I have earned a BSc in Control Engineering and a MSc in Robotic and AI from UGAL in Romania.

I am a **seasoned researcher** with **15+ years of academic research** and **7+ years of industrial research experience**. My research was disseminated in **50+ [peer-reviewed publications](http://cristianaxenie.info/publications/) and 10+ patents**.
