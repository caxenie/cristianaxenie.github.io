Dr Cristian Axenie is **[High Tech Agenda Bayern](https://www.hightechagenda.de/experte/prof-dr-cristian-axenie/) Professor** of [Artificial Intelligence for Heterogenous Sensor Data](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/person/axenie-cristian/) and **Research Group Leader** of [SPICES Lab](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/fakultaeten/in/forschung/cognitive-neurocomputing/) at the [Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/) in Nürnberg, Germany. After earning a **Dr. Eng. Sc. in Neuroscience and Robotics** from [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), Dr Axenie was **Research Fellow in Neuromorphic Engineering** with the [TUM Center of Competence Neuroengineering](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/) before joining [Huawei Research Center](https://www.huawei.com/en/corporate-information/research-development) in Munich. With Huawei, Dr Axenie was **Staff Research Engineer** in Enterprise Intelligence for Cloud Solutions with Huawei's largest research centre outside China. At the same time, Dr Axenie was **Head of the Laboratory** and **Principal Scientist** at the [Audi Konfuzius-Institut Ingolstadt Laboratory](https://audi-konfuzius-institut-ingolstadt.de/forschung/microlab-home.html) at [Technical University of Ingolstadt (THI)](https://www.thi.de/), a Sino-German research initiative focused on Human-centered Artificial Intelligence. Dr Axenie teaches every term Data Fusion, TinyML, and Neuromorphic Engineering for Computer Science undergrads. Earlier, Dr Axenie earned a **B. Sc. in Control Engineering** and a **M. Sc. in Robotics and AI** from [University of Galati](https://ugal.ro/) in Romania.
