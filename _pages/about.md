Research approach
====
My research agenda focuses on fusing mathematical modelling, dynamical systems and control, machine learning, and computing systems to design and implement end-to-end solutions across domains. In the last 15 years, I have built an applied research agenda focused on tools and a framework for optimizing dynamical systems (i.e. biological, technical) to achieve adaptability, autonomic calibration, and reinforced performance. Fundamentally, the key approach I am using is a domain-aware and domain-informed machine learning framework that amounts to introducing appropriate observational, inductive or learning biases that can steer the learning process towards identifying domain-consistent solutions.

Short vita
=====

After earning a PhD in Neuroscience and Robotics from TUM in 2016, I've spent one more year with the TUM Center of Competence Neuroengineering before joining Huawei Research Center in Munich. Since 2017 I am Staff Research Engineer in Enterprise Intelligence with Huawei's largest research center outside China. At the same time, I lead the Audi Konfuzius-Institut Ingolstadt Lab, a Sino-German research initiative focused on Human-centered Intelligence Data Processing. Each term, I teach AI and ML for undergrads in TH Ingolstadt. 

I am a seasoned resercher with more than 12 years of academic research and more than 7 years of industrial research experience. My reserch was disseminated in more than 40 peer-reviewed publications and more than 10 patents.
