*[Short vita](http://cristianaxenie.info/cv/)*

Since April 2023, Dr Cristian Axenie is **Professor** of [Artificial Intelligence for Heterogenous Sensor Data](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/person/axenie-cristian/) and **Research Group Leader** of [SPICES Lab](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/fakultaeten/in/forschung/cognitive-neurocomputing/) at the [Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/) in Nürnberg, Germany. After earning a **Dr. Eng. Sc. in Neuroscience and Robotics** from [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/) in 2016, Dr. Axenie spent one more year as **Research Fellow in Neuromorphic Engineering** with the [TUM Center of Competence Neuroengineering](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/) before joining [Huawei Research Center](https://www.huawei.com/en/corporate-information/research-development) in Munich. Between 2017 and 2023 Dr. Axenie was **Staff Research Engineer** in Enterprise Intelligence for Cloud Solutions with Huawei's largest research center outside China. At the same time, Dr. Axenie was **Head of the Laboratory** and **Principal Scientist** at the [Audi Konfuzius-Institut Ingolstadt Laboratory](https://audi-konfuzius-institut-ingolstadt.de/forschung/microlab-home.html) at [Technical University of Ingolstadt (THI)](https://www.thi.de/), a Sino-German research initiative focused on Human-centered Artificial Intelligence. Each term, between 2017 and 2021, Dr. Axenie taught AI and ML for undergrads as **Lecturer** at THI. Dr. Axenie earned a **B. Sc. in Control Engineering** and a **M. Sc. in Robotics and AI** from [University of Galati](https://ugal.ro/) in Romania.

Dr. Axenie is a **seasoned researcher** with **15+ years of academic research** and **7+ years of industrial research experience**. His research was disseminated in **50+ [peer-reviewed publications](http://cristianaxenie.info/publications/) and 10+ [patents](http://cristianaxenie.info/cv/)**.

*[Research approach](http://cristianaxenie.info/portfolio/)*

Dr. Axenie's research agenda is centered on **artificial intelligence** techniques and systems for **data-driven science and engineering** problems. More precisely, Dr. Axenie is combining **mathematical modelling, control theory, data fusion, machine learning, simulation, and hardware** to design and implement **efficient end-to-end intelligent systems** across [domains](http://cristianaxenie.info/portfolio/).
