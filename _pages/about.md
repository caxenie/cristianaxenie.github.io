**Cristian Axenie** is **[High Tech Agenda Bayern](https://www.hightechagenda.de/experte/prof-dr-cristian-axenie/) Professor** of [Artificial Intelligence for Heterogenous Sensor Data](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/person/axenie-cristian/) and **Research Group Leader** of [SPICES Lab](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/fakultaeten/in/forschung/cognitive-neurocomputing/) at the [Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/) in Nürnberg, Germany. At the same time, Dr Axenie is **Group Leader** of the **Neuromorphic Computing Solutions Team** at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS)](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en.html), funded by a prestigious [Attract Research Grant](https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/jobs-and-career/professionals/fraunhoferattract-funding-program.html). 

**Cristian Axenie** is a **Steering Committee Member** of the **AI Impact Initiative, AI4GOOD** of the [International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and United Nations (UN)](https://aiforgood.itu.int/speaker/cristian-axenie/). At the same time, he is **Member** of the [**Open Neuromorphic**](https://open-neuromorphic.org/contributors/cristian-axenie/) Community and **Invited Speaker** of the [**Alan Turing Institute**](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/guest-speakers/cristian-axenie) in the UK, supporting the **awareness**, **acceptance**, and **adoption** of neuromorphic technologies in the industrial context.

After earning a **Dr.Eng.Sc. in Neuroscience and Robotics** from [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), Dr Axenie was **Research Fellow in Neuromorphic Engineering** with the [TUM Center of Competence Neuroengineering](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/) before joining [Huawei Research Centre](https://www.huawei.com/en/corporate-information/research-development) in Munich. With Huawei, Dr Axenie was **Staff Research Engineer** in Enterprise Intelligence for Cloud Solutions with Huawei's largest research centre outside China. At the same time, Dr Axenie was **Head of the Laboratory** and **Principal Scientist** at the [Audi Konfuzius-Institut Ingolstadt Laboratory](https://audi-konfuzius-institut-ingolstadt.de/forschung/microlab-home.html) at [Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI)](https://www.thi.de/), a Sino-German research initiative focused on Human-centred and Embodied Artificial Intelligence. Dr Axenie teaches Neuromorphic Engineering, TinyML, and Data Fusion every term for Computer Science undergrads. Earlier, Dr Axenie earned a **B.Sc. in Control Engineering** and a **M.Sc. in Robotics and AI** from [University of Galati](https://ugal.ro/) in Romania.
