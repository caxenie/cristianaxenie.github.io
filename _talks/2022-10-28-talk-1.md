Kick-off and introduction of the [ANTIGONES Collaborative Research Project: Designing antifragile large-scale traffic frameworks](https://www.ivt.ethz.ch/en/svt/projects/antigones.html) 
at the [Institute for Transport Planning and Systems of ETH Zurich, CH](https://www.ivt.ethz.ch/en/).

Goals: 

- Design and develop a framework to fuse physics knowledge in the design of the large-â€‹scale system optimization by means of machine learning, control theory, and simulation in order to achieve antifragile behavior at scale.
- Provide an instantiation of the framework for traffic optimization.
- Provide a validation and deployment tool in the form of software tools.
