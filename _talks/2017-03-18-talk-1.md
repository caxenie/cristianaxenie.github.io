"Cristian is a researcher in neuroengineering, his projects being based on the development of algorithms with neural networks, software and hardware for different real-time systems that can impact the evolution of medical prostheses. The young man from Galati completely dedicates his professional activity to the exact sciences. He loves math, computers, but also French. In his passion for robotics, he obtained a research fellowship in neuroscience and robotics from the Technical University of Muninch. After 5 years of specialized studies in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, Cristian is now working on creating new technologies, inspired by the operation of the brain and their application in neuroprosthetics. In the laboratory he uses artificial devices, such as a silicon retina and silicon cochlea."
